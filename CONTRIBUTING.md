Pull requests are **not** being merged right now. This is due to various reasons - mainly being that Figma project files are binary files so they can't be merged by Git.

At the moment, new badges are not being added, however I can make changes to existing badges if needed. If you need your own badge that isn't already in the repository, you can use the badge template in the `/other` folder. Simply open it up with Figma and follow the instructions.
