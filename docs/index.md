# üèÖ About

This is Devin's Badges! A project I work on in my spare time that contains cool badges for you to use in your projects.

I aim to be as consistent as possible with these. I also try to make these look great on most modern sites.

## üì∞ Using in your project

Want to add these badges to your page? Well, here's how!  

Head over to the [badges page](./badges) to find the badges most fitting for your use. You can then copy the HTML code, which I recommend for best customizability, or the Markdown code for the badge you would like to use, and paste that into your file.  

Using SVG (`*_vector.svg`) versions are recommended so you don't lose quality when resizing the badge.

You don't need to add credit - it would be nice for you to do so, but I really don't care if you do or not. I just make these for fun!

### üìÑ Some guidelines I recommend following

While you don't have to do this, I recommend following these guidelines to make sure the badges look great on your page.

- Don't modify the badges unless needed
- Keep badge sizes in the recommended heights (available on the [badges pages](./badges))
- Don't have the badges too close to other text

## ‚ûï Adding more badges

Want to add your own badges to the project? Feel free to open up an issue and I'll make one! This project is made with Figma. If you are opening a PR, I will probably edit your badge just to make sure it fits in as well as possible with the rest.

## ‚ùó Disclaimer

This is currently a work in progress, I only have a few badges for a few services right now. However, I am planning to have a lot more badges in the coming weeks.
